# BubbleSort-Presentation-Repo
This Repo contains an example of bubble sorting in C++

What is bubble sorting?:
Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
In C++ it works by repeatedly stepping through an array or vector, comparing each pair of adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
After each pass, the largest (or smallest) value “bubbles up” to its correct position. This process continues until a full pass occurs with no swaps.

Why bubble sort is important/how it is used:

1. Teaching tool: Bubble sort is often the first sorting algorithm taught because the logic is easy to visualize and implement in C++. It reinforces core concepts like loops, conditionals, indexing, and swapping values.

2. Understanding algorithm analysis: It provides a clear example for discussing best/average/worst-case performance, and why algorithm choice matters for large inputs.

3. Baseline for comparison: Bubble sort is used as a simple baseline to compare with more efficient algorithms like selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort.

4. Practical niche uses: While rarely used for large datasets, bubble sort can still be acceptable for very small arrays, nearly sorted data, or resource-constrained situations where simplicity and tiny code size are more important than speed.
